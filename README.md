## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between various cement ingredients and the resulting compressive strength of the cement. Using regression models, it aims to predict the compressive strength based on compositional features.

Key objectives:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on cement dataset.
- Preprocess data (scaling, feature selection).
- Train and evaluate regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
- Visualize model performance and feature importance.

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identify correlations and distributions.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values (if any), scale features using StandardScaler.
3. **Modeling**: Train regression algorithms such as:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Mean Square Error (MSE)
   - R² Score
5. **Visualization**: Plot actual vs. predicted values and feature importances.

---

## 🏆 Results

- The Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance with an R² score of **0.92** and an MSE of **5.4 MPa²**.
- Feature importance analysis indicated that **Age**, **Cement**, and **Water** are the top predictors.
